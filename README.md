**Welcome to the open-operator repository!**

## Our Motivation
This project aims to provide the open-source community with an easy-to-use system for building, self-hosting, and evaluating web agent models. Our goal is to offer an alternative to the $200/month ChatGPT Pro and cloud-based, uncontrolled execution environments.

With open-operator, you can:
- Annotate your web trajectory data.
- Export the data for further processing.
- Prepare the data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
- Host and deploy the model to interact with live websites.
- Automatically evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

We believe in empowering developers to have complete control over their web agents, from training to deployment and evaluation.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Instruction on how to annotate your web trajectory data
- [ ] Data downloading
- [ ] Pre-process the data to be SFT-ready
- [ ] Host the model and inference on live websites
- [ ] Automatically evaluation using WebCanvas framework
